title: Snow Slowing You Down? Could be Worse, Could be the Weekend
---

Hello all!  Something unexpected popped up when exammining the New York City MTA Turnstile weekly data for a project, available here: http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html


While everyone knows New York City is always bustling with activity, even the city that never sleeps has to slow down when adverse conditions hit it.  Recently, two major snowstorms came through disrupting local commerce, on the 7th and 21st of March, and each disrupted commerce into the city's subway system to some degree.  Looking at subway entries into Penn Station, you can see noticeable dips in the middle of the work week for each storm (about 20% and 40% off usual, respectively):

More dramatic than that though? The sheer drop-off in weekend ridership of the subways.  Looking at several weeks of data shows just how few people actually enter the subway outside of a normal business day:

Looking to get that subway car all to yourself someday?  Don't bother if there's a blizzard outside, in turns out New Yorkers still need to get to work.
